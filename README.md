Hello Resume
This software creates resumes for users by arranging and formatting them using the React framework. With React components defined in the main file `Resume.js`, the structure and content are styled in the following `Resume.css` file.

An operational component that arranges the resume into sections—a header, education, abilities, work experience, and projects—is found in the `Resume.js` file. Sections are organized logically using JSX elements that resemble HTML, such as `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<div>`. Project section links open source code repositories in a new tab using anchor tags with characteristics.

To make the resume look good, you can use the styles provided by the `Resume.css` file. It specifies a central layout, colors, and fonts, and it applies designs to links, lists, and headers. A well-organized and expert résumé is the result of using custom classes such as `.header`, `.section`, and `.projects` to style each section consistently.
